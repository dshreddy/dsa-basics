# Sorting

- Insertion sort is an O(n^2) algorithm which works in way where it keeps one element at a time in it's correct position.
- Merge sort is tita(n*log(n)) algorithm that works based on recursion
- Quick sort is a tita(n*log(n)) algorithm that works in way in which one element is kept in it's sorted position in one iteration.
