# Heap

- Heap is a binary tree with the following 2 properties
    1. Structure property
    2. Order property

- Structure property : A binary heap is a complete binary tree i.e every single level tree apart from the last one should be completely full.
- Order property : The minimum value of the whole tree should be at the root & this is recursively true for all subtrees.
- Unlike BST's heaps can have duplicate elements.
- While pushing & popping heap we need to make sure that both the prooperties are not violated.
