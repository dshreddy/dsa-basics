# Hashing

<img src="tc.png">

- Hash set / unordered set is implemeneted using hashing
- Insertion into as hash set is O(1) operation
- Hash collisions can be handled using many ways like Chaining, Open Addressing
- The higher the size of the hash table the lesser the number of collisions
- If the size of hash table is prime number, the number of collisions will less
