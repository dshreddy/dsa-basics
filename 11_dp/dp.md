# Dynamic Programming

- With DP we can optimise recursive code using the approach of solving sub problems
- If you take recursive code & ad memoisation to it then it is called Top Down DP
- In case of Bottom Up DP we solve the smallest sub problem first & then use it to solve the the bigger problem
- Difference between DP, Divide & Conquer is : 
    1. In Divide & conquer we divide the subproblem into equal sizes
    2. In Divide & conquer there is no repetetion of solving a sub problem
- Time complexity wise most of the times memoisation & Bottom Up approaches will be same
