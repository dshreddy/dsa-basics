<h1>Trees</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Trees are non linear data structures</li>
    <li>Trees can't have any cycle</li>
    <li>Trees should always be connected</li>
</ul>

<hr>

- Nodes in Binary Trees should have either 2 children or no children
- Binary Search Trees (BST's) are a special type of binary trees 
- In a BST everything on the left subtree of a node should be < root node & everything on the right subtree of a node should be > root node & this prooperty should be hold for all subtrees
- Generally BST's can't have duplicates 

<hr>

- Set can be implemented using BST, insertion O(logN), removal O(logN)
