## Data structure

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. In the case of computer this data is stored in RAM

## Arrays

- Arrays are stored inside the RAM in a contigous block
- Since we need to allocate a contgous block of memory we need the size of the array before hand
- We use index to read/write an element from an array
- Reading/Writing an element from an array is O(1)
- Inserting/Deleting elements into an array is O(n)
`Example : array = |5|6| | => to insert 4 at index 0 we need to first move 6 to index 2, 5 to index 1 & only then we can insert 4 at index 0`
